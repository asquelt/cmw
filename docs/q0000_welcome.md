# Welcome!

* since version 4 puppet now uses semantic versioning for it's packages
* x.y.z
** x = api change
** y = new features
** z = bug and security fixes
* it also uses all in one (AIO) packaging
** ie. ruby interpreter is bundled
** no more legacy ruby bundled with os
** we can run faster!

# TODOs

* check puppet and ruby version
** puppet should be on path (```which puppet```), check where ruby is with ```dpkg```
* discover quest robot
** try to discover command line
** track your progress
** the whole quest idea comes from [puppet learning vm](https://github.com/puppetlabs/courseware-lvm/blob/master/Quest_Guide/)
*** but it uses opensource components!

# Bonus

* check out how puppet announces security updates
** and how to report issues to them
* check out how they track their tickets

# Next

* we'll learn how quest evaluates your progress
** let's go: ```quest --start Q0001_testing```
